          Just because we can nott get out and about like we normally would,
          doesn’t mean we have to stop taking pictures. There’s still plenty you
          can do, provided you are prepared to use some imagination. Here are a
          few ideas to keep you shooting until normal life resumes.

          Streets empty that are usually busy are remarkable and can evoke the
          sense of historical pictures from before the invention of the
          motorcar. Other things that are different at the moment will be queues
          to get into stores and the lines marked out on the floor to show how
          far apart we should be.

          Most photographers find it hard to see interesting pictures in places
          in which they are most familiar. A trip somewhere new seems always
          exactly what our photography needed, as shooting away from home
          consistently inspires us to new artistic heights.

          The trick here is to look slowly, and then look again. Take the time
          to look in detail and to look at the same thing from different angles,
          with different light, long lenses and wide lenses. Then move to the
          left a bit. You may never feel the need to leave the house again.

          Most photographers love to shoot the unusual, and you don’t get much
          more unusual than These Unprecedented Times. Right now everything
          counts as out of the ordinary. There are a number of remarkable things
          about these lockdown days that are worth photographing now so we can
          remember them when it is all over.
